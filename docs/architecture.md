## AudioRecorder — session lifecycle and recovery

`AudioRecorder` wraps `AVCaptureSession` with a `forceCleanup()` recovery contract (issue #1,
see `docs/decisions/D-1-01.md`):

- `startRecording()` calls `forceCleanup()` before the `isRecording` guard so stale state from
  a prior cancel or error path is always cleared before a new session begins.
- `handleCancelledState()` and `handleErrorState()` both call `forceCleanup()` to keep
  `isRecording` consistent with the actual `AVCaptureSession` state on every abnormal exit.
- `resetService()` calls `forceCleanup()` so a deliberate reset from the UI recovers a stuck
  mic without an app restart.

`forceCleanup()` is idempotent — calling it on an already-stopped session is a no-op.
